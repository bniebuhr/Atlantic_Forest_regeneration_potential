# Atlantic Forest regeneration potential maps

This repository presents scripts (in Python, to be run within a [GRASS GIS](https://grass.osgeo.org/) environment) to deal with lands use and land cover maps from 
the Atlantic Forest and prepare them
to model the potential of natural regeneration in landscapes of the Atlantic Forest.

The scripts with the algorithm to model natural regeneration potential based on the animal-mediated seed dispersal 
from forest patches may be found in this other Github repository: [seed dispersal mapper](https://github.com/LEEClab/seed_dispersal_mapper).

The input maps and the resulting maps of Atlantic Forest natural regeneration potential might be found in
this OSF Project: https://osf.io/xcasm/
